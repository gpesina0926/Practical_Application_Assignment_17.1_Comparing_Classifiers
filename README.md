# Practical_Application_Assignment_17.1_Comparing_Classifiers
Assignment Overview:
The goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) encountered in this section of the program. Will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

Data:
The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Data originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Deliverables:
After understanding, preparing, and modeling the data, build a Jupyter Notebook that includes a clear statement demonstrating an understanding of the business problem, a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics, findings (including actionable insights), and next steps and recommendations.

Data Understanding and Cleaning:
Business Problem - Describe the significance of identifying customers who respond positively to marketing campaigns.

Data Cleaning - Handle any missing values, outliers, and appropriate feature transformations.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Descriptive statistics - Provide an overview of customer attributes and response rates using measures like mean, median, mode, and proportions.

Visualizations - Develop charts for categorical (e.g., job, marital status) and continuous variables (e.g., age, balance).

Visualization Features - Add readable titles, labels, and consider subplots for different variable groups.

Modeling with Four Classifiers:
Model Training - Train k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines on the prepared dataset.

Evaluation Metrics - Provide accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to help evaluate each model.

Model Comparison - Summarize model performance metrics, analyzing which model works best for this business context.

Findings and Recommendations:
Interpret Findings - Present summary, with recommendations on improving campaign outcomes.

Results:
Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score

kNN	0.886188	0.435897	0.173469	0.248175

Logistic Regression	0.900552	0.590909	0.265306	0.366197

Decision Tree	0.865193	0.386792	0.418367	0.401961

SVM	0.895028	0.565217	0.132653	0.214876

Summary of Differences:
> Performance - kNN achieved moderate accuracy and lower precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to other models.
> Performance - Logistic Regression showed strong accuracy and F1 score, with higher precision than kNN, indicating it’s better at identifying likely  
  responders without a high false positive rate.
> 
> Performance - Decision Tree provided good recall, suggesting it’s able to capture many of the actual positives (responders) in the data, but with 
  lower precision than Logistic Regression.
> 
> Performance - SVM showed competitive accuracy but generally lower recall compared to Decision Tree, which suggests it may be less sensitive to 
  capturing all responders.

Actionable Insights:

The strong association of duration (call length) with positive responses suggests that longer, engaging conversations increase the likelihood of customer interest. This implies that training agents to engage customers meaningfully rather than rushing through calls could be beneficial.

The variables pdays (days since last contact) and previous (number of previous contacts) are significant predictors. Recent and consistent interactions can positively impact responses, indicating that a proactive follow-up strategy with recent contacts may yield better results.

Certain occupations and education levels are more receptive to the campaign, so future marketing efforts could focus on these segments. For example, targeting specific professions (like management or services) with tailored messaging could improve response rates.

The variable poutcome (previous campaign outcome) is highly predictive of future responses. Customers who responded positively in the past are more likely to respond again, suggesting that prioritizing previously successful customers in new campaigns could increase success rates.

Next Steps:

Based on insights from job type, education, and past response data, refine customer targeting by focusing on segments most likely to respond. This could involve creating customer profiles or personas that align with high-response segments.

Implement a structured approach to contacting customers, focusing on recency and frequency without overwhelming customers. Experiment with optimal intervals between contacts, perhaps setting limits on call frequency to maintain customer receptivity.

Use logistic regression or decision tree models to score customers based on their likelihood of responding. This approach enables prioritization in campaign planning, focusing on customers with high response probabilities.

Recommendations:

Develop campaigns that focus on high-response segments (specific job roles, education levels) and adjust messaging to resonate with these groups. For instance, a campaign could focus on job segments with more financial stability or on specific financial needs based on education.

Continuously monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns through model evaluations and inferential statistics. Update targeting strategies based on model results and data patterns to maintain relevance and effectiveness over time.
